Hypothetical Proteins
- Hypothetical proteins are genes that were predicted by annotation software (like Prokka), but they don’t match any known proteins in reference databases.
We could get the genes amino acid sequence and BLAST it (blastp) to see if newer databases had more information.

More Options
1. Can select top setting icon and select ”Three-frame Translate” to see stop and start codons. 
2. Can also select bottom setting icon and change track color, height, and name. 
3. Zoom in far enough and you can see all base pairs.
